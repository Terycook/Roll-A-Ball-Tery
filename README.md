# Roll-A-Ball-Tery
 
my game is incomplete due to bad timing. Got most of it done, but some of the major part were not complete.  i couldnt get the high score or score to work properly, for example the highscore would only read on the game screen but not the exit scene, and the rounds would read but not work in stopping the game after the amount of rounds were played. So i turned the assignment as is, incomplete.
